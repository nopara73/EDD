# The EDD Manifesto

Emotion Driven Development (EDD) aims to uncover better ways of developing software by combining the two most common abilities developers are said to possess: **systemic thinking** and **emotional intelligence**.

**How do you feel?** Are you **energised** at the start of this day? Then you should be out there and **implementing** something new. Are you **satisfied** with your code? Not yet? Why? Did you get **tired**? Maybe **bored**? Or, are you **disappointed** of the results? Or even worse, you are outright **disgusted** by your code? If so, start **refactoring** now, until you feel more **pleasant** about it. Then don't forget to write some **tests** to solidify the consensus. Finally it's time to submit it for a **code review** and hope someone will have enough **energy** to spot the **unpleasant** bugs and smells.

## The Algorithm

```
IF you have high energy AND feel pleasant
  THEN implement something new
ELSE IF you have low energy AND feel pleasant
  THEN 
ELSE IF you have low energy AND feel unpleasant
  THEN 
ELSE IF you have high energy AND feel unpleasant
  THEN   
```

## Developer Note

If this concept excites you, feel free to work it out and start selling Fun Master Certification trainings, I just threw this idea out there in a unique way, IDK, it's probably stupid.
