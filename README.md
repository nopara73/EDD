# The EDD Manifesto

Emotion Driven Development (EDD) aims to uncover better ways of developing software by combining the two most common abilities developers are said to possess: **systemic thinking** and **emotional intelligence**.

**How do you feel?** Are you **energised** at the start of this day? Then you should be out there and **implementing** something new. Are you **satisfied** with your code? Not yet? Why? Did you get **tired**? Maybe **bored**? Or, are you **disappointed** of the results? Or even worse, you are outright **disgusted** by your code? If so, start **refactoring** now, until you feel more **pleasant** about it. Then don't forget to write some **tests** to solidify the consensus. Finally it's time to submit it for a **code review** and hope someone will have enough **energy** to spot the **unpleasant** bugs and smells.
